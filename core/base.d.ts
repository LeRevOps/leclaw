/**
 * @leclaw/core — Agent base
 *
 * The framework every LeClaw agent is built on.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   Le Directeur  — orchestrates missions, dispatches agents, reads rapports
 *   les agents    — specialist workers, each owns one CRM domain
 *   Le Témoin     — validates proposed changes before write-back
 *   une mission   — a coordinated run dispatched by Le Directeur
 *   un rapport    — structured result filed by each agent after a run
 *   Le Retrait    — an agent that cannot complete its work withdraws cleanly
 *
 * Four principles baked into every agent:
 *
 * 1. TARGETED FETCHING   — only broken records are ever fetched
 * 2. RELATIONSHIP AWARENESS — association filters + escalation from CRM context
 * 3. DYNAMIC DISCOVERY   — auto-discover custom properties at runtime
 * 4. WRITE-BACK READY    — every broken record ID is captured, ready for fixes
