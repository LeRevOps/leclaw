## What Revtown Is

**Revtown is the open-source GTM agent hub.**

A canonical, growing collection of RevOps agents — community-built, CRM-native, deployable against HubSpot or Salesforce in two minutes. Think OpenClaw for CRMs and RevOps.

**Three things, working together:**

1. **The hub** — the agent library. Every agent encodes what "broken" looks like in a specific RevOps domain. Anyone can deploy any agent. Anyone can contribute one.
2. **The framework** (`@revtown/core`) — the open-source runtime. Defines how agents are structured, how they query the CRM, how they score and report. MIT licensed.
3. **Le Directeur** — the orchestrator. Deploys agents, synthesizes their output into a single answer. Works identically on CLI and dashboard — same logic, different runtime targets.

**Deploy path 1 — CLI:** `npx revtown` → Le Directeur REPL → pick agents → runs against your CRM → synthesized answer in terminal.

**Deploy path 2 — Dashboard:** app.revtown.io → connect HubSpot or Salesforce → click Run → agents run on Vercel → synthesized answer + Slack delivery + write-back queue (Le Témoin).

Same agents. Same synthesis. Two surfaces.

**The hub is the product. Le Directeur is the orchestrator. The framework is the glue.**

```
Data quality audits       → Le Data Quality    ✅
Pipeline reviews          → Le Stage Audit     ✅
BDR follow-up enforcement → Le BDR             🔜
Forecast integrity        → Le Forecast        🔜
Lead routing QA           → Le Plumber         📋
Territory coverage        → Le Territory       📋
Renewal risk              → Le Renewal         📋
Commission accuracy       → Le Commission      📋
QBR prep                  → Le QBR             📋
Write-back / fixing       → Le Témoin          ✅ (app layer)
Activities hygiene        → Le Activities      📋
Duplicate resolution      → Le Duplicates      📋
Deal desk hygiene         → Le Deal Desk       📋
```

Every feature decision, every architecture choice, every session should move toward this. If it doesn't add agents, enable the community to add agents, or make Le Directeur smarter — deprioritize it.

**The community flywheel:** A BDR manager knows what SLA failure looks like. A CSM knows renewal risk. The framework makes it easy to contribute an agent (filterGroups checks + a summary prompt) — no engineering background required. Every contributed agent is institutional RevOps knowledge that runs in hundreds of CRMs.

**Positioning:** "Welcome to Revtown — a town of RevOps specialists, each one watching a different corner of your CRM. Le Directeur coordinates them all."

**ICP:** Any B2B company with a sales team and a CRM. Primary: Head of RevOps / VP Sales Ops at Series B–C SaaS, $10–50M ARR. Secondary: GTM engineers who want to encode their own domain knowledge and contribute to the hub.

**Open source and forkable by design.** Framework is MIT licensed. Clone it, run it against your own CRM, fork it, contribute agents back. The open source repo is the top of funnel. The hosted dashboard is the monetization layer.

**Live at:** https://revtown.io
**Dashboard:** https://app.revtown.io (leclaw-app repo)
**npm:** `@revtown/core` (current version: 0.3.6)
**GitHub:** https://github.com/LeRevOps/leclaw
**Stack:** Node.js, TypeScript, Claude API, HubSpot API, Salesforce API, Slack API, Vercel, Supabase

## Two Repos — Two Surfaces, One Framework

| Repo | Path | Purpose | Users |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| `leclaw` | `C:\Users\Benjamin\leclaw` | Open source framework + CLI (`@revtown/core` on npm) | GTM engineers, developers, contributors |
| `leclaw-app` | `C:\Users\Benjamin\leclaw-app` | Hosted SaaS dashboard (app.revtown.io) — Next.js + Supabase | RevOps managers, non-technical users |

**This CLAUDE.md is for the `leclaw` repo (open source framework).**
The `leclaw-app` repo has its own CLAUDE.md.

### Why two repos

The same `@revtown/core` framework powers both. The split is intentional — open core business model, same as Supabase, PostHog, Metabase.

- **`leclaw` (public, MIT)** — anyone can clone, fork, run agents against their own CRM, contribute new agents. Community and top of funnel. No terminal skills required for basic use (`npx revtown`).
- **`leclaw-app` (private)** — the hosted product. Supabase auth, billing, multi-tenancy, dashboard UI, Le Témoin write-back queue. Contains secrets and business logic. Never public.

### Execution architecture — two surfaces, one framework

```
CLI (open source)                              DASHBOARD (hosted)
─────────────────────────────────              ────────────────────────────────────────
npx revtown                                     app.revtown.io
  └── Le Directeur REPL                          └── Ask Le Directeur / Run Mission
        └── routeQuestion()                            └── Next.js API route (Vercel)
        └── Docker available?                                └── runAgentForOrg()
              YES → runAgentInDocker()                             └── runAgent() ← @revtown/core
                     └── docker run --rm                                └── HubSpot / SFDC API
                           └── agent-runner.js                    └── onIssue() → Supabase
                                 └── runAgent() ← @revtown/core    └── Slack delivery
              NO  → runAgent() ← @revtown/core                     └── Le Témoin write-back queue

Le Directeur synthesis — IDENTICAL on both surfaces:
  Haiku per agent (summary) → Sonnet once (synthesis) → answer
```

**Le Directeur is CRM-agnostic.** It dispatches agents, collects rapports, synthesizes. Whether the underlying agent talks to HubSpot or Salesforce is an implementation detail the orchestrator doesn't care about.

**Docker is CLI-only.** Vercel serverless cannot run containers. Dashboard users only run Revtown's vetted agents — Vercel's ephemeral isolation is sufficient. Docker matters for developers running custom/third-party agents. Resource-limited to 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU, removed on exit. Falls back to in-process if Docker unavailable.

## Architecture — `leclaw` (Open Source)

```
npx revtown
  └── cli/index.ts (Le Directeur)
        └── keyword router → selects agents
        └── runAgent() × N → Haiku summary per agent
        └── callClaude(Sonnet) → single synthesis answer

npx revtown setup
  └── setup.js
        └── opens HubSpot/Anthropic/Slack in browser
        └── verifies each connection
        └── writes .env → launches CLI

@revtown/core (npm)
  └── core/base.ts              — runAgent(), types, scoring, callClaude(), WritebackPatch
  └── core/hubspot-search.ts    — paginated targeted search (never full scans)
  └── core/hubspot-write.ts     — applyPatch(), applyBatch() for write-back
  └── core/hubspot-properties.ts — dynamic custom property discovery
  └── core/registry.ts          — agent registry
  └── core/routing.ts           — keyword router
  └── core/synthesis.ts         — Le Directeur synthesis prompts + run history/trends
```

## Agent Roadmap

The agent library is the product. Ship agents relentlessly.

| Priority | Agent | Domain | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| ✅ | Le Data Quality | Field completeness, relationship hygiene | Built |
| ✅ | Le Stage Audit | Deal velocity, pipeline health | Built |
| 🔜 | Le BDR | Follow-up SLA, unworked MQLs, bounce hygiene | Next |
| 🔜 | Le Forecast | Commit accuracy, coverage ratio, at-risk deals | Next |
| 📋 | Le Plumber | Routing gaps, unassigned leads, round robin health | Planned |
| 📋 | Le Renewal | Renewal risk, upcoming dates, health signals | Planned |
| 📋 | Le Territory | Coverage gaps, alignment, rep assignment | Planned |
| 📋 | Le Commission | Accuracy, dispute prevention, quota hygiene | Planned |
| 📋 | Le QBR | Automated QBR prep, trend analysis | Planned |
| 📋 | Le Duplicates | Identity resolution, merge candidates | Planned |
| 📋 | Le Activities | Meeting/call logging gaps, engagement hygiene | Planned |
| 📋 | Le Deal Desk | Discount hygiene, deal structure, approvals | Planned |

**12 agents = a full RevOps team. That is the goal.**

## Important Technical Notes

- **Env var is `HUBSPOT_TOKEN`** — not `HUBSPOT_API_TOKEN`. Fixed Mar 2026.
- **Never full-scan the CRM** — all HubSpot fetches use search API with filterGroups.
- **Model cascade:** Haiku per agent → Sonnet once for synthesis.
- **`setup.js` is plain JS** — not compiled by tsc. Edit directly.
- **bin entry must not have `./` prefix** — `"leclaw": "cli/index.js"` not `"./cli/index.js"`.
- **npm publish must run from `C:\Users\Benjamin\leclaw`** — not a parent directory.
- **Le Directeur synthesis is shared logic** — core exports `buildSynthesisPrompt()`. Both CLI and app import it. Never duplicate it.
- **npm package renames are blocking** — never update imports in leclaw-app before the renamed package exists on npm. Rename the code, publish, then update imports. Doing it in reverse breaks the Vercel build silently.

## Environment Variables
```
HUBSPOT_TOKEN=         # HubSpot private app token (CRM scope)

## Business Context

**ICP:** Head of RevOps or VP Sales Ops at Series B B2B SaaS, $5-50M ARR, 50-300 employees.

**Pricing:**
- Free: 5,000 records, shadow mode only, 1 CRM
- Growth: $149/mo — 50k records, write-back, 1 CRM
- Scale: $499/mo — unlimited, multi-CRM, team access
- Enterprise: Custom

**Business model:** Open core. Framework is MIT. Hosted product is freemium SaaS.

**Competitors:**
- n8n (open source, requires engineers)
- Momentum/Attention (reactive, not proactive)
- Cargo (YC S23, GTM workflow builder — execution not monitoring, different angle)
- Openprise/Syncari (enterprise, $50k+/yr)
- LeanData (routing only)
- LangChain Deep Agents (GTM reference impl, open-sourced March 2026) ← emerging threat

**Core insight:** RevOps teams fear being blindsided in front of the CRO. Revtown is the town where every specialist is already watching their corner of the GTM stack. The moat is not the framework — it is the encoded domain knowledge in the agents. Every contributed agent adds a resident specialist to the town. That compounds.

**Every session should move toward the agent library goal. If a decision doesn't add agents, enable others to add agents, or make Le Directeur smarter — it is a lower priority.**

## Major Decisions (March 2026)

These are architectural and strategic decisions made in prior sessions. Do not relitigate them.

### Rebrand: LeClaw → Revtown (March 2026)
The product was renamed from LeClaw to Revtown. One word. Le Directeur and all agent names are unchanged — they are brand assets, not product names. The French vocabulary (Le Directeur, un rapport, une mission, Le Témoin) is grounded in Lyon, France — Revtown is built in the spirit of Lyon, where RevOps is treated like a civic function. This is not an affectation; it has a real anchor and is a deliberate marketing differentiator. Do not suggest renaming Le Directeur or the agents.

**npm package rename is in progress:** `@leclaw/core` → `@revtown/core`. Package renamed in `leclaw/package.json` (v0.3.7) but NOT YET PUBLISHED to npm. `leclaw-app` currently still imports `@leclaw/core` until publish is complete. When Benjamin publishes, update `leclaw-app/package.json` and all TS imports to `@revtown/core`. **Never update imports before the package exists on npm.**

### Brand identity (March 2026)
- **Color scheme:** White/warm (`#FAF8F5`) background, terracotta (`#C85C38`) accent. Dark clay (`#2A1A12`) for contrast sections (quote, CTA, footer). Revtown wordmark: "Rev" in terracotta, "town" in ink. Applied to `index.html` (revtown.io).
- **Positioning line:** "Le Directeur runs your RevOps the way a Director would, catching problems before they become your problem in front of the CRO."
- **Lyon anchor:** The French naming is intentional and has a real geographic home. Lean into it in marketing — it signals precision and craft.

### Hub positioning (March 2026)
Revtown is not a CRM audit tool or a RevOps automation platform. It is the open-source GTM agent hub — the canonical place where RevOps practitioners encode domain knowledge as agents. Le Directeur is the orchestrator that deploys any hub agent. This positions Revtown like OpenClaw for CRMs/RevOps: the value compounds with every agent contributed.

### Le Directeur works on both surfaces (March 2026)
The synthesis logic (`buildSynthesisPrompt`, run history, trend awareness) lives in `@revtown/core` and is shared. CLI and dashboard both import it. The difference is only runtime: CLI uses Docker or in-process; dashboard uses Vercel serverless. The orchestration and synthesis output are identical.

### Docker for CLI (not dashboard)
Added Docker container isolation to the CLI in v0.3.5. Each agent runs in its own container (`leclaw/runner:0.3.6`) — 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU, removed on exit, no host filesystem access. Credentials passed as env vars. Falls back to in-process if Docker unavailable.

**Why CLI only:** Vercel serverless can't run containers. Dashboard users only run Revtown's vetted agents — Vercel's ephemeral isolation is sufficient. Docker matters for developers running custom/third-party agents. Benjamin works at Docker — this is deliberate product alignment.

### Open core split
`leclaw` is public MIT. `leclaw-app` is private. Same `@revtown/core` framework powers both. `lib/agents/runner.ts` (75 lines) is the only app-layer addition — Supabase persistence wrapper around core's `runAgent()`.

### Async execution (March 2026)
Dashboard API routes return `{ run_id }` immediately. Agent runs in background via Next.js `after()`. Client polls `/api/runs/[runId]` every 2s. `maxDuration` raised to 300s.
